# 1: Introduction
This book is about Cypress, a modern, all-in-one, end-to-end testing framework. It was written because Cypress was made to be easy to learn, but not as easy to master. The Cypress Getting Started guide is great for beginners, though it will not hold your hand past the basics. I've written this book to help the uninitiated use Cypress, and help those who are already using Cypress, inch closer to mastery.

## About the Author
My name is Adil Iqbal.  I began my programming career at a start-up called GeoNotebook. Prior to my arrival, the dev-team had dabbled with testing. As we built out the app, a day came when all of our existing tests were out-dated and began to break. I was assigned to revamp our entire testing setup. Not only did I update the testing setup and fix the old tests, I began to write new tests as well and established myself as the go-to testing guru at my company.

I also learned that *tests are (almost always) best written by the developer who built the feature being tested.* I presented Cypress to my team members, taught them the ropes, and made myself available as they began to write tests themselves. Then I thought, *why limit my newfound expertise to just the developers in my company?*
