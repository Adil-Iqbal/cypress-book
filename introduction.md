# 1: Introduction
This book is about Cypress, a modern, all-in-one, end-to-end testing framework. It was written because Cypress was made to be easy to learn, but not as easy to master. The Cypress Getting Started guide is great for beginners, though it will not hold your hand past the basics. I've written this book to help the uninitiated use Cypress, and help those who are already using Cypress, inch closer to mastery.

## About the Author
My name is Adil Iqbal.  I began my programming career at a start-up called GeoNotebook. Prior to my arrival, the dev-team had dabbled with testing. As we built out the app, a day came when all of our existing tests were out-dated and began to break. I was assigned to revamp our entire testing setup. Not only did I update the testing setup and fix the old tests, I began to write new tests as well and established myself as the go-to testing guru at my company.

I also learned that *tests are (almost always) best written by the developer who built the feature being tested.* I presented Cypress to my team members, taught them the ropes, and made myself available as they began to write tests themselves. Then I thought, *why limit my newfound expertise to just the developers at my company?*

## Target Audience
This book is for 4 categories of readers:

1. The non-user who would like to begin using Cypress.
2. The beginner who would like to improve their abilities to use Cypress.
3. The advanced user who would like a refresher.
4. For anyone who would like an overview of Cypress.

The book itself is structured with these four types of readers in mind. Though, I consider the first category the most important, I've written this book with all four categories in mind. This book is divided into two units: (1) Basics and (2) Advanced. These units 

### Pre-requisite Familiarities
For any readers who fall into category #1 or #4, it's worth mentioning that using Cypress requires a certain amount of pre-requisite knowledge. You do not have to have absolute mastery of any of these pre-requisites, but the better you know them, the more you'll be able to accomplish with Cypress.
