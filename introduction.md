# 1: Introduction
This book is about Cypress, a modern, all-in-one, end-to-end testing framework. It was written because Cypress was made to be easy to learn, but not as easy to master. The Cypress Getting Started guide is great for beginners, though it will not hold your hand past the basics. I've written this book to help the uninitiated use Cypress, and help those who are already using Cypress, inch closer to mastery.

## About the Author
My name is Adil Iqbal.  I began my programming career at a start-up called GeoNotebook. Prior to my arrival, the dev-team had dabbled with testing. As we built out the app, a day came when all of our existing tests were out-dated and began to break. I was assigned to revamp our entire testing setup. Not only did I update the testing setup and fix the old tests, I began to write new tests as well and established myself as the go-to testing guru at my company.

I also learned that *tests are (almost always) best written by the developer who built the feature being tested.* I presented Cypress to my team members, taught them the ropes, and made myself available as they began to write tests themselves. Then I thought, *why limit my newfound expertise to just the developers at my company?*

## Target Audience
This book is designed with 4 categories of readers in mind:

### The non-user who wants to get started.
Cypress does *a lot* to make new users feel comfortable using their tool. The Getting Started section on their website is a great place to start. When Cypress is initially installed, they include example test files that you can play around with to get a good feel of how Cypress operates. They've published a ton of example code if you need help beyond what's provided out of the box. The documentation is also stellar and designed for easy referencing.

In addition to what Cypress provides, you have *yet another* resource in this book. This book will present that information in a digestible way that will set you up to *improve quickly*. The first unit is called **The Basics** and it assumes no prior knowledge of testing. The information you'll find there will be utilized heavily in the next unit and I recommend everyone reads it.

This book was designed with all four categories of readers

### Pre-requisite Familiarities
For any readers who fall into category #1 or #4, it's worth mentioning that using Cypress requires a certain amount of pre-requisite knowledge. You do not have to have absolute mastery of any of these pre-requisites, but the better you know them, the more you'll be able to accomplish with Cypress.
