		* Using .skip
		* Using .only
		* Remove .skip and .only before pushing or use https://github.com/bahmutov/stop-only

	* Unit exercises
		* Repo instructions
			* git clone & npm install
			* place all exercises in same it block unless asked to created another one.
			* try yourself without reference.
			* Then reference book and docs.
			* Then check solutions below.
			* Hand holding until exercise #10.
		* Exercise Solutions and references
			* Exercise 1 - Run a test and visit repo
			* Exercise 2 - Set the baseUrl and $schema in cypress.json
			* Exercise 3 - Select a button, run an assert, and click it.
			* Exercise 4 - Only use the selector cy.get("button"). Ensure that there are three buttons on the page. Click these buttons in this order (first, last, middle).
			* Exercise 5 - Check three checkboxes and submit.
			* Exercise 6 - Check one of two radios and submit.
			* Exercise 7 - Select div, and check a checkbox in sibling div and submit.
			* Exercise 8 - Type a string into a text field and submit
			* Exercise 9 - Get the contents of a p tag and type it into the textbox.
			* Exercise 10 - Only use the following selector: get("[type=checkbox]"). 4x4 matrix of checkboxes. Only check checkboxes with label "Pick Me!" and click submit.
			* Exercise 11 - 4x4 matrix of checkboxes. Only check checkboxes with id attr of "a" OR "b"
			* Exercise 12 - 4x4 matrix of checkboxes. Only check checkboxes with id attr of "a" AND "b".
			* Exercise 13 - Create a second it block and ask it to log "second it block." Create a after hook and insert the following code (scroll down, click button)
 			* Exercise 14 - Add a before, beforeEach, and afterEach hook that clicks the buttons on toolbar below.
# Advanced
* Writing Tests: Advanced
	* The Test Runner Tour: Advanced
		* The Test Runner is a dev tool.
		* Re-run on save + .only or .skip
		* Decreases test feedback loop.
		* (and flag because it can get annoying).
		* Selector Playground
		* DOM Screenshots and the screenshot() command.
		* Command Log pinning & the console.
		* Useful in debugging.

* Test Composition
	* it block
		* Pending it functions
		* Call back to standalone it.
			* Repeated code in subsequent it functions 
			* Remove problematic code?
			* Merge tests?
			* Use a before hook.
	* Building complex app state.
		* It alone inside a describe.
		* It with a before hook inside a describe.
		* It with two before hooks inside a describe.
		* It with three before hooks, one inside a nested describe.
		* It with four before hooks, one of them being a root level describe.
		* Cleaning app state
			* Excessive state cleaning runtime problem 
			* State cleaning via login and dangling state.
			* Cleaning global app state using before and support/index.js
			* Clean app state in before hook, THEN build new app state.
			* Failure in one test can affect subsequent tests. Tests that are further down on the list are more flaky. Sometimes clean app state *within* the it block prior to its execution.
* Identifying Elements
	* Focused element. (google.com example) (contrast with .focus())
	* Narrow search filter/not
	* Scoping within/root
	* Aliasing? Before each, cleared before hook.
	* Window/document/title
	* Cookies
		* Clear cookie behavior \*clears before every it
		* getCookie and getCookies
	* Intro to wrap
* Interacting with the Server
	* Request
	* Repetitive DOM manipulation
	* Testing the API.
	* Circumventing CSRF and forwarding redirects.
